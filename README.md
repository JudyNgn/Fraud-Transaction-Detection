Achieved high recall on fraudulent cases, balancing sensitivity and precision to minimize both false positives and false negatives, critical in fraud detection.

- **Feature_Impact:**  
Identified key transaction characteristics (such as amount patterns, frequency, and anomalies) most indicative of fraud, improving model interpretability and actionable value.

- **Business_Insight:**  
Highlighted behavioral and transactional trends distinguishing fraudulent activity, offering practical insights for improving fraud monitoring systems.

- **Visual_Takeaways:**  
ROC curves and confusion matrices provided clear, interpretable evaluations of model performance, guiding optimization choices and model selection.
